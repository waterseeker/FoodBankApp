FoodBankApp

This is an ap to help a foodbank collect and use data. The aim is to increase data quality and make the experience of the end-user of the foodbanks services easier.

Front end: Please use the color pallet from the foodbanks website. http://www.feedingal.org/ the landing page should include : fixed header with link to feedingal.org log-in in the body that will then load page with functionality based on user.

User Stories :

I can create a user account with different permissions based on how I am using the ap.
I can import existing Excel spreadsheet data into the database.
I can input new data into the database through a form input in the ap.
I can opt in for reminders to be sent to me (through text message / email) about upcoming services/obligations that apply to me.
I can find the closest service location to my address/current location.
I can schedule an appointment for services/drop off/volunteering.
I can opt in to be contacted about additional services I may qualify for/be interested in.
I can generate an Excel spreadsheet from a form input / the database.
I can click on links to go to other service providers sites/aps. (need to get a list of relevant ones and their requirements from Jon).
the user stories may need to be split up based on the type of user. i.e. someone looking to donate to or get info about the foodbank will not get the option to upload data to the database.
